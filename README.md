# Uber Ride Pricing Analysis and Regression Model
This project analyzes Uber ride data from New York City (2009â€“2015) to understand fare patterns and build a simple predictive model for weekend prices. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and Python was used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Goals:

Analyze how average fares change depending on the time of day

Compare weekday and weekend pricing patterns

Build a linear regression model predicting average weekend fares by hour

One key finding showed that weekend fares consistently peak in the early morning hours. This project highlights my ability to work with real-world data, deliver meaningful analysis, apply machine learning techniques, and communicate insights that can inform dynamic pricing strategies.
